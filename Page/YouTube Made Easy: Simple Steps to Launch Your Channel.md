## 1. Define Your Niche

## 3. Prepare for Recording

Before pressing record, gather the tools you need for high-quality content creation:

- **Camera:** A smartphone with a good camera or a dedicated DSLR/mirrorless camera.

Editing lets you trim errors, add effects, and keep your content polished and professional.

Use these insights to refine your strategy and focus on what resonates most with your audience.
