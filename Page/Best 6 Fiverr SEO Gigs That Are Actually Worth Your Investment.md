Fiverr often gets a bad reputation in the SEO community for its abundance of low-quality services.

Here are 6 Fiverr SEO gigs that are actually worth considering:

## 1. Surfer SEO Optimization Gigs

Surfer SEO is an incredibly effective tool designed to help SEOs optimize their content for target keywords. By analyzing the top-ranking pages for over 500 on-page signals, Surfer provides actionable insights and recommendations to improve your content.

If you’ve been struggling to rank a specific post despite all your efforts, investing in a Surfer optimization gig on Fiverr can be a cost-effective alternative to subscribing to Surfer’s $49/month plan.

A good example is **Vinciseo's Surfer SEO gig**:

- **Basic** – £11.44: Re-optimize 1 keyword, 1 page. Add 2 FAQ questions.
- **Standard** – £38.15: Re-optimize 3 keywords, 3 pages, 3 NLP reports, 6 FAQ questions.
- **Premium** – £72.48: Re-optimize 6 keywords, 6 pages, 6 NLP reports, 15 FAQ questions.

A detailed technical audit is a crucial first step in any SEO strategy. It helps identify and fix critical site issues that might be holding you back from achieving your SEO goals.

Many Fiverr gigs offer "SEO audits," but only a few deliver actionable insights. One standout is **Gorilla Marketing's gig**, which provides high-quality audits tailored to your site:

- **Basic** – £286.12: A basic SEO and content video audit with actionable tips.
- **Standard** – £343.34: Includes competitor analysis and recommendations.
- **Premium** – £419.64: Comprehensive competitor analysis for up to 4 competitors.

Poor-quality backlinks can seriously harm your website’s ranking. Fiverr offers gigs to help you identify toxic links and create a disavow file to clean up your backlink profile.

One reliable option is **Frank_seo1’s gig**, which provides thorough toxic backlink audits:

- **Basic** – £38.15: Analyze up to 250 root domains.
- **Standard** – £76.30: Analyze up to 500 root domains.

Adding high-quality images or videos can significantly enhance the value of your content, improving user experience and helping your pages rank higher.

For instance, Fiverr designers can create step-by-step instructional images for “how-to” articles. If you’re writing a DIY or tutorial guide, gigs like this one are incredibly helpful.

Local citations are critical for improving your visibility in Google Maps and local search results. They verify your business details, such as name, address, and phone number, across various directories.

While creating citations manually can be time-consuming, Fiverr offers cost-effective gigs for outsourcing this task. For example, **Seobacklinks150's gig** provides:

- **Basic** – £3.81: 20 UK Local Citations.
- **Standard** – £7.63: 50 UK Local Citations.
- **Premium** – £22.89: 140 UK Local Citations.

Adding alt text to images helps search engines understand and index your images correctly, which can improve your website's SEO and image search rankings.

If you’re managing a site with hundreds of images, outsourcing alt text optimization is a time-saver. **Umair9141’s gig** is a solid choice:

- **Basic** – £7.63: Optimization for 2 pages (meta tags, H tags, alt tags).
- **Standard** – £53.41: Optimization for 12 pages with a detailed SEO audit report.

## Gigs to Avoid on Fiverr

While there are plenty of great SEO gigs on Fiverr, some should be avoided:

### 1. Keyword Research Gigs

Most keyword research gigs simply provide an export from SEO tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush without real analysis or actionable insights. Instead, consider subscribing to a tool like Ahrefs for $7 (7-day trial) to perform your own research.

### 2. Link Building Services

Buying backlinks from Fiverr is risky and can harm your website in the long run. Avoid gigs offering “1,000 High DA Backlinks” or “SEO backlinks from guest posts.” These links are often spammy and can lead to penalties from Google.

## Conclusion

Fiverr offers a variety of SEO gigs that can be incredibly useful if chosen wisely. From Surfer SEO optimization to local citations and toxic link audits, these services can save time and provide real value for your website. However, avoid low-quality gigs that promise quick results, as they can do more harm than good.
