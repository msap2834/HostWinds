# How to Make Money with AI: A Freelancer's Journey to $10,000 per Month

Are you looking to earn a six-figure income leveraging artificial intelligence? One year after the launch of ChatGPT, countless freelancers are doing just that. Even better, they believe almost anyone can use AI to make money.

Consider the story of **Mark Kashef**, a 29-year-old Canadian who helps people navigate ChatGPT, earning $10,000 a month.

> “Just days after ChatGPT launched, I began consulting on [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr),” he says. “Suddenly, my monthly income grew from a few hundred dollars to thousands. It’s thrilling as a freelancer.”

Kashef specializes in prompt engineering and even uses AI tools to pitch to potential clients. His projects have included automating admission forms for a psychiatrist and creating customized children’s books for an author. Both clients saw significant productivity and profitability gains through automation.

## How to Make Money with AI

Kashef is one of many AI experts making a fortune helping others adapt to this new working environment. Take **Louie Martin**, for example. The 38-year-old balances a full-time job with a side hustle using the AI tool MidJourney for graphic design, earning up to $150 per hour.

> “It’s just a side gig for me, but I could double or triple my income if I devoted more time to it,” Martin shares.

Both experts agree: you don’t need to be an AI specialist to start making money with these tools. Nearly any freelance business can use AI to automate repetitive tasks, create innovative products, or design impactful marketing materials. AI tools can even help you find clients and pitch your business ideas.

### Finding Your Niche

With hundreds of AI tools available—and more being developed daily—it’s impossible to master them all. Instead, focus on identifying a specific need for your business or one you can fulfill for others. Learn how AI can help you deliver your product or service faster and more efficiently. The narrower your niche, the better.

For example, Martin focuses on creating book covers using MidJourney. Each year, tens of thousands of books are published, many by self-published authors who need compelling artwork to communicate their book’s content. Martin noticed a gap in the market for skilled cover artists and filled it.

> “There are plenty of people who can design book covers cheaply, but they often do a poor job,” Martin explains. “I can offer covers tailored to specific design elements authors want while using AI to quickly generate multiple variations.”

By leveraging AI, Martin can create dozens of cover designs that meet his clients’ specific requirements without spending hours manually editing images.

### Conducting an AI Audit

If you’re unsure how AI can benefit your business, Kashef suggests conducting an AI audit. This process identifies repetitive tasks you can assign to AI, freeing up your time for more strategic and creative activities.

Start by clearly defining what you do and why you do it. Then, list specific tasks that must be completed weekly or monthly to keep your business running. Finally, consider what makes your product or service unique. Processes that are necessary for operations but don’t define your brand are prime candidates for automation.

Examples include:
- Bloggers using AI to create engaging, SEO-optimized headlines.
- Web developers employing AI to write code.
- Graphic designers, like Martin, creating artwork variations.
- Interior designers virtually arranging furniture in digital spaces.

## Lifelong Learning with AI

AI is evolving at an unprecedented pace. Even if you’re an expert in your field today, you must continually read, experiment, and learn to stay ahead.

Kashef dedicates an hour each day to researching industry developments and documenting new applications of AI in his business.

Additionally, consider enrolling in courses or watching YouTube tutorials to master the tools you need. As AI products grow and add features, staying updated ensures you can use them effectively.

### Get Expert Help

Not sure where or how to start? Seek assistance from an expert.

While free YouTube tutorials are readily available, investing a small amount to hire a professional can save you time and effort. Kashef advises reaching out to industry associations or unions to find specialists in your field. Alternatively, you can find a wide range of AI experts on [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr). Many offer one-on-one tutorials at reasonable rates.

> “If spending $50 or $100 saves you two days of work, wouldn’t you do it?” Kashef asks.

## Disclosing AI Usage

If your product or service is partially or fully AI-generated, both Kashef and Martin recommend transparency. This can be included in your website’s terms of use, contract templates, or even as a selling point in your marketing materials.

While AI disclosures are not yet mandatory, Martin finds that clients appreciate honesty, helping them better understand the value of his services. However, it’s worth noting that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may soon require AI disclosures in certain cases.

> “There’s very little that can’t be improved by AI,” Kashef says. “You can use it to elevate your business and make it extraordinary.”
